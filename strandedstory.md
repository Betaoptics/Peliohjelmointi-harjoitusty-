The traveller crashlanded into Mars and was Stranded there.

// Upon crashing.
T: - I. I survived! But. But where am I? What is this place?

// Upon walking a bit further.
T: - Looks like my equipment was damaged and I am leaking oxygen. I am glad my pistol is still with me in case I need it. I need to find some kind of shelter.

// Upon approaching the base.
T: - Wait. What is that? Is that an old mining structure of some kind? It seems abandoned.

// Very soon after the player also notices the monsters.
T: - But wait. What are those things? It looks like they are surrounding that structure and they look hostile.

// Upon clearing the base from the enemies and trying to enter the building but failing.
T: - Ugh. I can not seem to get in. I need to find a way to fix the doors and it seems like the pipe on the left of the structure is broken.

// Continues...
T: - I need to find a way to fix this base. I think I saw some kind of device when I was crash landing on the mountains West of the base. I should go check it out.

// Upon obtaining the item.
T: - This seems like a perfect fit, I should go try installing it to the pipe and see if that would fix it.

// Upon fixing the pipleline.
T: - There we go, the base is operational! But ugh, when I fixed the base a splinter flew out and damaged my equipment more, now I am draining oxygen out extra fast.

// Continues:
T: - I should get inside quickly and see what supplies I can find.

// When player pressures air and gets inside.
T: - Ahhh. Fresh air. Phew. That was a close one but it seems like this base is giving me free supply of air when I need it.

// When the player approaches the plants.
T: - I am hungry and I seem to have gotten some wounds. By the manual description next to these plants, it read these plants have some nourishment and healing properties. I should eat them.

// When the player enters the vending machine, the vending machine goes:
T: - Welcome! Welcome! Welcome to the MinersMerch Corporation! Here you can browse all the products your hearts desperately desire. No refunds!

// When the player finds the vending machine.
T: - There is not much in stock but it appears it sells ammo and there are two flares. 
I can probably use those flares to get out from this planet but they are expensive and I can not afford them yet.
However it seems like those monsters drop currency for this machine. I wonder what happened to the miners?

// When the player obtains the flare.
T: - I should go and find somewhere to shoot this flare. It will take a while for the rescue team to come so I will have to survive before then.

// If the player survived but did not shoot the flare high enough.
T: - Where are they! Why did no-one come? It seems like I shot the flare too low and it did not reach high enough into the atmosphere and nobody saw my flare.
I have to go and boy another one and shoot it from higher up in the mountains.

// If the player shot both of the flares and did not shoot them high enough.
T: - Oh no, the base is no longer accessible and I am all out of flares. I am going to die here! But if I am going down, I am going down fighting!
// Player proceeds to play final stand where they run out of HP or Oxygen and then they die.


// If the player successfully survived and shot the flare high enough in terrain.
T: - I did it! I survived! Here comes the rescure party!
// Play victory screen.
