// Upon crashing.
T: - I. I survived! But. But where am I? What is this place?

// Upon walking a bit further.
T: - Looks like my equipment wasn't damaged and I have a pistol still with me in case I need it. But now I have to find some kind of shelter.

// Upon approaching the base.
T: - Wait. What is that? Is that an old mining structure of some kind? It seems abandoned.

// Very soon after the player also notices the monsters.
T: - But wait. What are those things? It looks like they are surrounding that structure and they look hostile. I might have to take them down.

// Upon clearing the base from the enemies and trying to enter the building but failing.
T: - Now that those are gone. Let's try to get into the base.
T: - Ugh. I can not seem to get in. I need to find a way to restore power to the base. I should check the power cable.

// Continues...
T: - I think I saw part of the cable when I was crash landing on the mountains West of the base. I should go check it out.

// Upon fixing the pipleline.
T: - There we go, the base should have power again! Let's go and try to get in.

// When player pressures air and gets inside.
T: - Ahhh. Fresh air. That was a close one but it seems like this base is giving me free supply of air when I need it.

// When the player approaches the plants.
T: - I am hungry and I seem to have gotten some wounds. I should check if there's something to eat.

// When the player enters the vending machine, the vending machine goes:
T: - Welcome! Welcome! Welcome to the MinersMerch Corporation! Here you can browse all the products your hearts desperately desire. No refunds!

// When the player finds the vending machine.
T: - There is not much in stock but it appears it sells ammo and beacons. 
I can probably use that beacon to get out of this planet but they are expensive and I can not afford them yet.
However it seems like I get points from those monsters. I wonder what happened to the miners?

// When player goes to kill monsters for points
T: - I should go and start looking for those monsters and get the rest of the points for that beacon and get out of this planet.

// When the player obtains the beacon.
T: - I should go and find a spot from high ground to set this beacon. It will take a while for the rescue team to come so I will have to survive before then.

// If the player successfully survived and shot the flare high enough in terrain.
T: - I did it! I survived! Here comes the rescue party!
// Play victory screen.
